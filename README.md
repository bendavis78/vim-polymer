vim-polymer
===========

Vim support for [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

Includes HTML/CSS syntax for polymer elements, as well as a [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) syntax checker for [polylint](http://github.com/PolymerLabs/polylint).

Note: polylint is a bit slow. Consider trying q0LoCo's [syntastic async fork](https://github.com/q0LoCo/syntastic) which uses tmux and/or gvim for async linting.
